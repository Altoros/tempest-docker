We created docker parent image with Tempest and prerequisites. It located in  ykisialiou/tempest-parent repo. Tempest has quite large and complicated config, used for all test sets, unfortunately it is full of sensitive data (such as API accessing user with credentials). So, itâ€™s would be better to configure  a lot of options on your side (users credentials, network options, openstack components and features, used on your installation).  tempest.config is self documented and most of options described well. We also provide you config from our testing environment, maybe it will be useful. 

The testing process will consist of several steps on your side

Fill necessary options in tempest.conf
Create working directory and put tempest.conf there
Put tempest-run.Dockerfile to working directory
Build docker image with smth like
sudo docker build --file tempest-run.Dockerfile -t yourrepo/tempest-run .
Run docker image  by executing smth like
sudo docker run yourrepo/tempest-run > testing_results
Sent us testing_results file


If you look at testing_results file and see errors, it is not necessary you Openstack problems. Sometimes it may be connected with  tempest misconfiguration or bugs.
